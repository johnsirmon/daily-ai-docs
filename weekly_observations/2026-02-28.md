# Weekly Observations (2026-02-28)

## Learnings from Top Repositories

### 1. Build Small, Modular Agents
- Avoid creating large, monolithic AI agents.
- Focus on small, specialized agents with specific responsibilities.
- Use an orchestrator agent to manage tasks.

### 2. Emphasize Prompt Engineering
- Design stepwise, clear prompts to promote reasoning and action.
- Techniques include Chain-of-Thought prompting, ReAct (Reasoning + Acting), and structured outputs like JSON.

### 3. Leverage Open-Source Frameworks
- Frameworks like AutoGen, Memex, and SuperAGI simplify development.
- Choose frameworks with strong community support and tutorials.

### 4. Focus on Iterative Testing
- Frequently test agents independently and within workflows.

### 5. Trust and Safety
- Prioritize security and trustworthiness in AI agents.
- Monitor API interactions and limit permissions.

### 6. Adopt Multi-Agent Patterns
- Build distributed multi-agent systems for task specialization.
- Avoid shared memory to simplify scaling and debugging.

### 7. Documentation First
- Maintain robust documentation for future maintainability.
- Document prompts, logic, and integrations.

### 8. Rapid Prototyping with Real Tasks
- Start with workflows like automating document management or API queries.
- Scale complexity as confidence and understanding grow.

This weekly update summarizes emerging trends and practices in agentic development. Future observations will build upon these insights.
