A source-backed briefing for AI developers: what changes your work, what is worth trying, and what to ignore.

## Podcast

Intended subscriber feed: `https://johnsirmon.github.io/daily-ai-docs/podcast.xml`

Publication is confirmed only after the subscriber feed, audio, and artwork pass delivery checks.

Once the feed is live, open Apple Podcasts on iPhone → Library → Follow a Show by URL and paste it. CarPlay uses the followed show through Apple Podcasts; device playback still requires verification.

See [operations and setup](docs/OPERATIONS.md#github-setup) for deployment status and setup.

## How it works

1. Public primary sources are collected with per-source health reporting.
2. Ranking and editorial checks reject repeats, routine noise, and unsupported claims.
3. The episode manifest binds every selected story to its evidence and becomes the source of truth.
4. Narration or reviewed browser audio is validated before an immutable release is created.
5. Publication is confirmed only after the feed serves the exact expected episode and media bytes.

A healthy thin-news day can intentionally skip publication. Failures before candidate publication leave the existing subscriber feed untouched. A delivery failure after deployment can leave an unconfirmed candidate visible; it must be recovered without replacing its audio or advancing novelty state.

```

Approved manual imports join the same serialized publisher; issue intake and unpublished previews do not publish episodes. The diagram shows the successful publication path and intentional skip; validation failures stop the run. HTTP delivery checks do not certify iPhone or CarPlay playback.

## When and where it publishes

| Process | Trigger / target time | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Daily publisher](.github/workflows/update-radar.yml) | Daily **10:17 UTC** (06:17 EDT / 05:17 EST), or manual | Evaluates new evidence; publishes only when gates pass. |
| [Reviewed imports and specials](docs/OPERATIONS.md#publishing-approved-notebook-audio) | Manual, after review and authorization | Uses the daily publisher with a `reviewed_episode` release tag. |
| [Pages recovery](.github/workflows/pages.yml) | Relevant pushes to `main`, or manual | Redeploys the existing feed and artwork; does not generate audio. |
| [Feed health](.github/workflows/feed-health.yml) | Daily **12:47 UTC** (08:47 EDT / 07:47 EST), or manual | Checks delivery and a 25-hour freshness budget; accepts verified intentional skips and reports failures in an issue. |
| [YouTube discovery](.github/workflows/youtube-trends.yml) | Sunday **11:23 UTC** (07:23 EDT / 06:23 EST), or manual | Updates an input digest, not a standalone podcast episode. |

These are GitHub Actions schedule targets, not guaranteed release times. Publication requires preparation, release upload, Pages deployment, and subscriber-facing verification. Apple Podcasts refreshes and downloads independently; there is no scheduled push directly to Apple or CarPlay.

- **Discovery:** [RSS feed](https://johnsirmon.github.io/daily-ai-docs/podcast.xml) and show artwork on GitHub Pages. The Pages site does not host episode MP3s or the rendered README.
- **Audio:** [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/johnsirmon/daily-ai-docs/releases), using a permanent, unique enclosure URL for each episode. Released bytes and GUIDs are never replaced.
- **Written brief:** this README on the repository's `main` branch, generated from the episode manifest.
- **Audit trail:** [`data/episodes`](data/episodes), [`data/receipts`](data/receipts), [`data/runs/latest.json`](data/runs/latest.json), and [`data/state.json`](data/state.json). The manifest/RSS timestamp is assigned before delivery; `confirmed_at` records successful verification.

Daily publishing, standalone Pages deployment, and weekly digest writes share the non-cancelling `podcast-publisher` lock. The daily job deploys Pages inline rather than waiting on another locked job. See [publishing review and optimization priorities](docs/OPERATIONS.md#publishing-review-and-optimization-priorities).

## Try the Notebook browser pilot

1. Sign in to Gemini Notebook and create a dedicated notebook for the pilot.
2. Add only the selected public primary-source URLs; include full methods and limitations for research.
3. Configure an English Deep Dive targeting 5–8 minutes with concrete changes, implications, and caveats.
4. Generate once, download once, and complete the native Save dialog manually if the browser cannot.
5. Preserve the original file, fully decode it, measure its duration, and record its size and SHA-256.
6. Review the transcript and consequential spoken claims against the imported primary sources.

The pilot uses the signed-in account's existing allowance. It does not authorize a paid upgrade, cookie export, unattended browser automation, or publication. Approved recordings use the separate [reviewed-audio handoff](docs/OPERATIONS.md#publishing-approved-notebook-audio).

## Today's signal

Long-form special for Working AI developers choosing what to test, adopt, or skip this week.
Evidence window: 20 days ending 2026-09-29T20:06:12.670648+00:00.
Audio provider: edge; exact synthesis-input script/source reviewed; no ASR or human listening claimed, not Gemini API verification.

### A cheaper coding model changes the test matrix, not the verdict

**What to know:** GPT-6.1 Sol launched in the API, Codex, and a gradual GitHub Copilot rollout with a materially different token-price position from Astra.

**What changes for developers:** Teams can test a stronger middle tier for repetitive agentic coding, but vendor benchmarks do not establish performance on a specific repository or total workflow cost.

**Recommendation:** SKIP — Skip launch-day benchmark chasing; run a bounded repository-specific comparison that records quality, retries, latency, cached-input use, and total spend.

### Managed agent infrastructure is now a buy-versus-build decision

**What to know:** The public-beta Agents API packages the Codex harness, long-running context management, tools, sandbox choices, and subagent orchestration behind an API.

**What changes for developers:** Teams with bespoke orchestration can now compare it with a managed path, but beta status, token and tool costs, environment boundaries, and portability remain decision factors.

**Recommendation:** WATCH — Pilot one bounded noncritical workflow and measure failure recovery, observability, permissions, and cost before considering migration.

### An existing REST gateway can become the MCP server

**What to know:** Google Cloud API Gateway can expose annotated OpenAPI 3.x operations as MCP tools in Public Preview while retaining gateway controls.

**What changes for developers:** Teams already on the gateway may avoid a separate translation service, but public tool discovery and preview limitations require deliberate configuration.

**Recommendation:** ACT — Pilot one read-only internal operation, require JWT-protected discovery, and verify schema translation before exposing broader capabilities.

## High noise / low signal

- Routine repository release fragments and minor maintenance changes were excluded.
- Vendor benchmark results are treated as vendor-reported evidence, not independent measurement.

## Editorial contract

- Scheduled daily at **10:17 UTC**; GitHub Actions timing is best-effort.
- One to three useful stories, at most one per canonical product and one research item; thin-news runs skip instead of padding.
- Opt-in grounded editorial mode groups meaningful changes into 5–8-minute briefs without changing the feed on thin-news days.
- Grounded mode can include one reviewed recent-paper takeaway, with its method, limitations, and practical experiment; it does not repeat papers as filler.
- Product-change claims require public primary evidence.
- This edition preserves a conversational format; `ACT`, `WATCH`, or `SKIP` recommendations appear in the written story notes, not as required spoken endings.
- Routine patches, repeated announcements, unsupported adoption claims, and engagement-only rankings are filtered out.
- At most one transcript-backed YouTube learning pick may appear; it never replaces vendor evidence.

## Tracked areas

The active `daily.sources` configuration in [`topics/topics.yaml`](topics/topics.yaml) monitors public releases and feeds for GitHub Copilot, VS Code, OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Hermes Agent, MCP, and Agent Skills. Evaluation and observability are covered through bounded YouTube learning discovery rather than dedicated primary-source collectors.

## Source health

- `github:copilot-sol`: ok:primary-reviewed
- `google:mcp-gateway`: ok:primary-reviewed
- `openai:agents-api`: ok:primary-reviewed
- `openai:gpt-6.1-sol`: ok:primary-reviewed

Each edition manifest distinguishes healthy no-news results from source outages.

## Publication flow

`collect → select → manifest → narrate/audio → validate → publish → verify delivery → confirm`

The versioned episode manifest is the source of truth for narration, show notes, and this README. Preparation and failed delivery do not advance novelty state.
All intentional skips have durable run receipts. Monitoring still verifies the last confirmed feed, audio, and artwork and rejects failed or stale evaluations.

## Weekly YouTube signal

The Sunday **11:23 UTC** workflow runs four focused searches and retains up to five videos with short transcript-derived takeaways. Full transcripts are never committed, and at most one deduplicated learning pick may enter a daily edition.

## Development

```bash
# Reproducible test suite
uv run --with-requirements requirements.lock pytest -q

# Network-free manifest preparation; writes only under .cache/
uv run --with-requirements requirements.lock \
  python -m pipeline.daily prepare --dry-run --no-audio
```

Preparation does not publish or modify the subscriber feed. See [operations and setup](docs/OPERATIONS.md) for credentials, deployment, recovery, and manual commands.
